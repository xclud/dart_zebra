## What is Zebra

Zebra is a barcode-scanner entirely written in Dart supporting real-time localization and decoding of various types of barcodes such as **EAN**, **CODE 128**, **CODE 39**, **EAN 8**, **UPC-A**, **UPC-C**, **I2of5**, **2of5**, **CODE 93** and **CODABAR**. The library is also capable of using flutter's `camera`plugin to get direct access to the userâ€™s camera stream. Although the code relies on heavy image-processing even recent smartphones are capable of locating and decoding barcodes in real-time.


## Getting Started

In your `pubspec.yaml` file add:

```dart
